                <h3>Knowledge</h3>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Shooting Efficiency</h4>
                    <p>Klay Thompson demonstrated exceptional three-point shooting ability during the 2022-2023 season. With 10.59 three-point attempts per game and a 41.2% success rate, he established himself as one of the league's premier long-range shooters. His 58.4% proportion of three-point attempts relative to total shots highlights his specialized role as a perimeter scorer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Role Definition</h4>
                    <p>Thompson's statistical profile reveals a specialized offensive role with limited defensive contributions. His relatively low averages in rebounds (4.1), steals (0.7), and blocks (0.4) per game indicate a focus on scoring rather than all-around play. This single-function approach is typical for elite shooters who maximize their offensive impact.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Season Progression</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>Analysis of Thompson's scoring patterns reveals significant volatility throughout the season. Using a 5-game moving average, we can observe that Thompson started the season relatively slowly, peaked in the middle portion of the season, and then leveled off at a more consistent range toward the end. This pattern suggests both recovery from previous injuries and adaptation to the team's evolving offensive strategies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Compare to other players</h4>
                    <p>Klay Thompson's 3-Point Shooting Performance is the No.2in the league in 2022-2023 Regular Season, only behind his teammate Stephen Curry. He is still the best 3-Point Shooter in the league, with a 4.4 Shots per Game, and a 41.2% Shooting Percentage.</p>
