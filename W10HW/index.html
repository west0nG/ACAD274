                    <p>This is a scatter plot chart that shows the relationship between field goals per game and the total points per game</p>
                    <p>From the chart, we can see that there is a positive relationship between field goals per game and the total points per game. The more the team shoot, the more points they will score.</p>

                    <p>From the chart, we can see that the 2-points balls are still more than 50% of the total score, while 3-points balls are a little bit less, and free throws are the least.</p>
